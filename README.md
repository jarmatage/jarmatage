- 👋 Hi, my name is Joaquin Armatage (@JayAwkWyn).
- 👀 I’m interested in logic design and enjoy doing RTL projects that I test out on FPGA.
- 🐍 I also know some basic machine learning methodologies and dabble with Python projects using packages like PyTorch. 
- 🌱 I'm trying to get better with Python and C (the latter being useful for OS design and instruction set architecture)
- 💞️ If there is a kaggle competition or any other project you would like to collaborate on, shoot me an email!
- 📫 You can reach me at j.armatage12@gmail.com and I'll try to reply timely.
